### Section 1.1: Propositional Logic

#### Key Concepts
- Propositions as the building blocks of logical reasoning
- Truth values and logical operators
- Compound propositions and truth tables
- Application to computer science and programming

#### Definitions
**Proposition**: A declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.

**Truth Table**: A table showing all possible truth value assignments for propositional variables and the resulting truth values of compound propositions.

**Logical Operators**: 
- Negation (¬¨): NOT
- Conjunction (‚àß): AND  
- Disjunction (‚à®): OR
- Conditional (‚Üí): IF-THEN
- Biconditional (‚Üî): IF AND ONLY IF

#### Programming Connection
Propositional logic directly maps to Boolean operations in programming:
- AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!) operators

## üíª Programming Applications

### Application 1: Boolean Logic Operations
**Problem**: Implement efficient boolean operations for complex conditions

**Mathematical Concept**: Propositional logic and Boolean algebra

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
def evaluate_complex_condition(user_authenticated, user_role, resource_public, resource_owner):
    """
    Implement access control logic:
    Access granted if: (authenticated AND (admin OR owner)) OR resource is public
    """
    is_admin = user_role == "admin"
    is_owner = user_authenticated and resource_owner == user_authenticated
    
    return (user_authenticated and (is_admin or is_owner)) or resource_public
```

**Time Complexity**: O(1)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Application 2: Truth Table Generator
**Problem**: Generate truth tables for logical expressions

**Mathematical Concept**: Truth tables and logical operators

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
def generate_truth_table(variables, expression):
    """
    Generate truth table for a logical expression
    """
    n = len(variables)
    truth_table = []
    
    for i in range(2**n):
        assignment = {}
        for j, var in enumerate(variables):
            assignment[var] = bool((i >> j) & 1)
        
        result = evaluate_expression(expression, assignment)
        truth_table.append((assignment.copy(), result))
    
    return truth_table
```
